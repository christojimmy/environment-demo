Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to creating an Angular project with environment variables for different configurations (production and development):

Step 1: Install Angular CLI
Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed on your machine. You can install it globally by running the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Step 2: Create a new Angular project
Create a new Angular project by running the following command:
```
ng new environment-demo
```
This will create a new directory named `environment-demo` with the initial project structure.

Step 3: Navigate to the project directory
Navigate to the project directory by running the following command:
```
cd environment-demo
```

Step 4: Generate environment files
In the `src/environments` directory, you will find two files: `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`. Open `environment.ts` and replace its content with the following code:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  message: 'This is the development environment',
};
```
Next, open `environment.prod.ts` and replace its content with the following code:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  message: 'This is the production environment',
};
```

Step 5: Modify the app component
Open the `src/app/app.component.ts` file and replace its content with the following code:
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { environment } from '../environments/environment';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: '<h1>{{ message }}</h1>',
})
export class AppComponent {
  message = environment.message;
}
```

Step 6: Update angular.json
Open the `angular.json` file and locate the `"configurations"` section under the `"build"` and `"serve"` options. Modify it to include the `development` and `production` configurations as follows:
```json
"configurations": {
  "development": {
    "fileReplacements": [
      {
        "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
        "with": "src/environments/environment.ts"
      }
    ]
  },
  "production": {
    "fileReplacements": [
      {
        "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
        "with": "src/environments/environment.prod.ts"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Step 7: Serve the application
To serve the application with the development configuration, run the following command:
```
ng serve --configuration=development
```
You should see the message "This is the development environment" in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.

Step 8: Build the application
To build the application for production, run the following command:
```
ng build --configuration=production
```
This will generate a production build of your application in the `dist/` directory.

Step 9: Serve the production build
To serve the production build, run the following command:
```
ng serve --configuration=production
```
You should now see the message "This is the production environment" in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.

That's it! You have now created an Angular project with environment variables for different configurations. The output will be different based on the configuration you choose (development or production).

Feel free to explore and make changes to the project to further understand how environment variables work in Angular.
